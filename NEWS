Version 0.13
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURES

* new release on CRAN.

* performs Bayesian non-parametric modeling on a (rectangular) set of functional data observations.

* The collection of functions may be modeled under Gaussian process (GP) or intrinsic Gaussian Markov

* random field (iGMRF) prior formulations.

* The covariance and precision parameters of the GP and iGMRF formulations, respectively, are placed under

* a Dirichlet process (DP) prior to allow the data to discover dependence among the estimated functions

* where co-clusters functions are drawn from distributions sharing the same covariance and precision parameters.

* the GP prior formulation is invoked with gpdpgrow()

* any number of additive covariance terms may be specified with gpdpgrow().

* for example, if there are 4 terms, then the input variable, gp_cov = c("rq","se","sn","sn")

* if the covariance functions for the 4 terms are structured as (rational quadratic, squared exponential,

* seasonal, seasonal), respectively.  The input variable, sn_order = c(3,12), sets the order for each seasonality

* term; in this case, 3 months and 12 months (assuming the data time scale is denoted by month).

* the iGMRF prior is invoked with gmrfdpgrow(), also allowing any number of additive precision terms

* the input variable, q_type = c("tr","sn","sn"), denotes "tr' = trend, and "sn" = seasonality terms.

* input, q_order = c(2,3,12) denotes the order for the associated term; for example, the second term

* is specified as seasonal of order = 3 (e.g. months).


CHANGES

08/10/2014
-----------
* version 0.1 launched on CRAN.

12/09/2014
----------
* replaced srand() with arma_rng::set_seed_random() to initialize random seed for RcppArmadillo.
* removed use of arma::sp_mat (sparse matrix) formulation for normalized CAR adjacency matrix from
  gmrfdpgrow() due to memory initialization issue in RcppArmadillo.

02/20/2015
----------
* removed use of arma_rng::set_seed_random() to avoid warning about setting R seed from C++. 

10/16/2015
----------
* Minor changes in anticipation of ggplot2 1.1.0

07/27/2016
----------
* return pop_plot and samp_plot ggplot2 objects in gen_informative_sample() that plot generated synthetic functions in the population 
and sample, respectively.
* employ uniform(0,1) starting values in the MCMC sampler when co-sampling the GP functions, bb, in gpdpgrow() to prevent numerical instability
producing NaNs in auxclusterstep() for sampling cluster assignments under Debian Linux.
